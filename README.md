# Face-Recognition 
I applied my Python programming skills to create a Face Recognition System using the powerful OpenCV library. The objective of this project was to build an efficient system capable of detecting and recognizing human faces in real time through a webcam feed. This project helped me explore the practical applications of Python in the field of computer vision.

To begin with, I used OpenCV to access the webcam and capture video frames in real time. I utilized the built-in Haar Cascade classifier for face detection, which allowed the system to locate and draw rectangles around faces with high accuracy. I then collected multiple images of each face to create a dataset for training the model.

For face recognition, I used the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm provided by OpenCV. I trained the recognizer using labeled face data and stored the trained model for future use. The system compares real-time input from the webcam with the trained model to identify known faces and display the corresponding names on the screen.

In addition, I implemented error handling and data validation techniques to ensure the system runs smoothly without interruptions. I also used basic Python file handling to manage the dataset and maintain logs for each recognition event.

This project allowed me to strengthen my understanding of Python libraries, especially OpenCV, and apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world application. It gave me hands-on experience in working with image processing, machine learning concepts, and object detection. Through this, I also improved my ability to write clean, modular, and reusable code.

Overall, the Face Recognition System project not only showcases my Python skills but also highlights my interest in building intelligent applications that bridge the gap between technology and real-world use cases.
